          Led by Lebron James and Anthony Davis, the Los Angeles Lakers were
          crowned the 2020 NBA champions after defeating the Miami Heat in Game
          6. Looking back, this championship means A LOT to the Lakers team:
          this was the first re-appearance of Lakers in the Playoffs since 2013;
          this was the 17th NBA titles in the team history, which helps Lakers
          tie with Boston Celtics for the first place among all NBA teams; this
          year, the world lost Kobe Bryant, and the Lakers needed this
          championship to pay attribute to Bryant and his daughter. This was a
          tough year, but the Lakers did it.

        <p>
          There’s no doubt about it: Lakers has the most glorious history among
          all NBA teams. Just take a look at all the retired jersey hanging in
          Staples Center: Elgin Baylor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson,
          James Worthy, Jerry West, Shaquille O’Neal, Kobe Bryant. Needless to
          say the 16 O’brien tropies it owns. With such glory, this team’s goal
          has never changed: the championship.

          Lakers suffered the longest playoff drought in franchise history since
          2013, after Kobe Bryant experienced a series of injury and decided to
          retire. Before that stretch, they had missed the playoffs only five
          times in their entire existence up to 2013. The team’s fortune turned
          around when Lebron James joined in 2018, followed by the trade for
          Anthony Davis in 2019. After that, the team is ready to fight for the
          highest honor again.

          Based on the will of both parties, Anthony Davis was traded to the
          Lakers. In order to get the 6-year All-star player, Lakers sent Lonzo
          Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and 3 first-round picks to New Orleans
          Pelicans. The price was high, but Lakers finally got the last piece
          towards the championship. Meanwhile, AD’s move to LA put him in a
          major market. He also had the chance to play deep in the playoffs for
          the first time in his career.

          Due to the trade for AD, Lakers had to sign many new players, and the

          playoffs experience and a desire for the champion.

              After losing DeMarcus Cousins to an ACL injury before him ever
              suiting up for the purple and gold, the Lakers signed Howard with
              a one-year, non-guaranteed, ‘prove it’ deal that the big man
              himself asked for.Due to the last unhappy experience Howard had
              with the team, Laker fans were still skeptical as to what kind of
              impact he would have for the team. Those prejudices were quickly
              squashed after only the third game of the season against the
              Charlotte Hornets, as the former All-Star played a perfect game,
              going 8/8 from the field, scoring 16pts with 19 rebounds, in only
              22 minutes of play.

              throws made in a single game, which was previously held by Dwight

              a close game against Luka Donic and the Dallas Mavericks, with the
              team down three with 6.4 seconds left on the clock. As James drove
              to the basket, he lasered a pass to a semi-open Danny Green in the
              corner, who calmly pump-faked a scrambling Seth Curry and nailed
              the game-tying 3-pointer to send the game into overtime.

              On January 25th, by making a simple drive to the basket, LeBron
              James passed Kobe Bryant for the third on the all-time scoring
              list. This is a moment that will, unfortunately, be forever
              intertwined with the tragic passing of one of basketball’s most
              legendary players, but that still shouldn’t take away from the
              importance of this monumental moment in sports. Kobe Bryant earned
              that coveted third spot on the all-time scoring list with
              those free-throws he sank against the Timberwolves in 2014.

              In the game against the Spurs, LeBron James went supernova from
              beyond the arc in the fourth quarter, and single-handedly put the
              game on ice. Each three created an even louder roar from the
              Staples Center crowd, culminating in a deafening cheer after the
              fifth and final 3-pointer from James. LeBron finished the game
              with 36 points, 7 rebounds, and 9 assists and went 6-9 from the
              3-point line in a blowout victory against the Spurs, 102-129,
              moving the Lakers to a 38-11 record.Also, that 4th quarter barrage
              vaulted him past Kobe Bryant for 16th on the all-time 3-point made
              list, marking yet another feather in the cap of one of the
              greatest players of all time.

              These two games were projected to be one of the toughest parts of
              the Los Angeles Lakers’ schedule. Back to back games against the
              two other teams who many have pegged as favorites to hoist the
              Larry O’Brien trophy.

              In the game against the Milwaukee Bucks, who had the best record
              in the league, and the reigning MVP in Giannis Antetokounmpo,
              the Lakers were firmly in the driver’s seat for the entirety of
              the game, and a late-game spin-move into a thunderous jam by
              LeBron James put the game on ice for good. LeBron ended up with a
              cool 37/8/8, and Anthony Davis chipped in with 30 points and 9
              rebounds on the way to a convincing 113-103 victory.

              The next challenge would be the Los Angeles Clippers. After losses
              against the Clippers on opening night and Christmas day, the team
              was eager to prove their status as a true championship contender,
              and they did just that in their third matchup of the season. This
              was a hard-fought, back and forth game from the opening tip, and
              was one of the few games of the season that truly had a playoff
              atmosphere. LeBron James made a 3-point play with 40 seconds left
              to put the game away for good. The team also got important
              contributions from the role players. These two victories were huge
              for the Lakers as the team was just starting to click heading into
              the playoffs. They convincingly beat two teams who were considered
              heavy favorites to win the championship, and the team’s chemistry
              was at an all-time high.
